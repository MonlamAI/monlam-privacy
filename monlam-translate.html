        <h2>Last updated: November 2025</h2>
        <p>
          Monlam Translate ("we", "us", "the App") is developed and maintained by <strong>Monlam AI</strong>. This
          Privacy Policy explains what information the app accesses, how features work, and your choices on Android and
          iOS.
        </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>1) Summary — the short version</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>We do not collect or sell your personal data.</strong> Translation input (text, images, audio) is
          processed on-device whenever possible. When an online service is required to fulfill your request, we only
          send the minimum content needed and we do not use it to build user profiles.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No tracking</strong> — we do not track you across apps or websites.</li>
          <li><strong>No ads</strong> — the app does not show ads.</li>
          <li><strong>No data brokerage</strong> — we do not sell or share data with data brokers.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>2) App permissions — what we access and why</h2>
        <p>The app may request access to certain device features to enable translation functionality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Microphone</strong> — voice translation and speech input. Audio is processed for
            transcription/translation and not stored on our servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Camera</strong> — capture text in images for OCR and translation. Images are processed for text
            recognition and are not uploaded to our servers for storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Photos/Media/Files or Storage</strong> — read/write offline models, caches, and downloads. These
            remain on your device unless you delete them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Network access</strong> — download language packs or request translations from our infrastructure or
            trusted providers when a cloud model is required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Location (optional)</strong> — if enabled by you, to improve language localization (e.g., default
            dialects). Location data is not stored on our servers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>2a) Android permissions (manifest detail)</h2>
        <p>The Android version declares the following permissions; each is used only for its stated purpose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>RECORD_AUDIO</code> — capture speech for voice translation.</li>
          <li><code>CAMERA</code> — capture text in images for OCR translation.</li>
          <li><code>INTERNET</code> — connect to download models/packs or request cloud translations.</li>
          <li>
            <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> / <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> — read/write offline models and
            caches on your device (on newer Android versions, scoped storage limits access).
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>READ_MEDIA_AUDIO</code> — access audio files you select for transcription/translation (Android 13+
            media permission).
          </li>
          <li><code>MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS</code> — adjust audio routing/volume for clear recording and playback.</li>
          <li>
            <code>BLUETOOTH</code> — optional, route audio to Bluetooth headsets during recording/playback; not used to
            collect data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code> / <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> — optional, improve language
            localization defaults. Location is not stored on our servers.
          </li>
          <li><code>WAKE_LOCK</code> — keep the device awake during long translations or downloads.</li>
          <li>
            <code>com.android.vending.CHECK_LICENSE</code> — verify Google Play license to prevent fraud; no personal
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>ai.monlam.monlamtranslate2.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION</code> — internal app receiver
            permission; does not expose user data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Hardware features reported by Google Play (camera, microphone, location, Bluetooth) reflect the above. These
          features are not used for ads or tracking.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>3) Data collection and processing</h2>
        <p>
          By default, we do not collect personally identifiable information. For certain features (e.g., cloud
          translation or speech recognition), the minimal input content you provide (text/audio/image) may be sent to a
          translation service strictly to fulfill your request. We do not attach persistent identifiers to this content.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not use this content to build marketing profiles, and we do not sell it. If the platform provider (e.g.,
          Apple/Google) or a cloud vendor processes it to provide the feature, their handling is governed by their
          terms.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>4) Third‑party services</h2>
        <p>
          The app may rely on platform or cloud services to process translations or speech (for example, device or OS
          speech services, OCR services, or managed translation APIs). We only transmit the minimal content needed to
          complete your request. We do not send additional personal identifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we add analytics or crash reporting in the future, we will disclose it here and within the app settings,
          and limit collection to anonymized diagnostics where possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>5) Data retention & deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We do not store personal data on our servers. Offline data, caches, and downloads stay on your device. You can
          delete them via in‑app options (where available) or by uninstalling the app / clearing app storage in device
          settings.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>6) Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The app is designed for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
          collect personal data from children.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>7) Your rights (EEA/UK & California)</h2>
        <p>
          If you are in the EEA/UK or California and believe the app processes personal data about you, you may have
          rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing. Because we do not collect personal data
          by default, these rights typically apply only if you provide data directly to us through support.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>8) Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data processed by the app. Since we avoid
          storing personal data on our servers, risk exposure is minimized.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>9) App Store / Google Play disclosures</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Apple App Privacy</strong>: Data Not Collected. We do not track users across apps or websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Play Data safety</strong>: No data collected; no data shared with third parties for
            marketing. Data may be transmitted to provide the requested translation and is encrypted in transit. You can
            request deletion by uninstalling the app or clearing app storage.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>10) Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. The “Last updated” date will change
          and we will note material changes in release notes or within the app.
